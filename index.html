<h3>Test Study</h3><br>
<p>KIDS COUNT is a national and state-by-state project of the Casey Foundation to track the status of children in the United States. Data available for analysis include family and child demographics, and measures of child educational, social, economic, and physical well-being.</p>
<p> The Survey Measures Catalog of the National Center on Health Statistics provides an overview of questions about child and adolescent mental health, and functioning and disability in various surveys of the NCHS Data Systems. Some of the survey measures are included in both the mental health section and the functioning and disability section of the catalog. </p>

<p>Nearly 93% of people in households with school-age children reported their children engaged in some form of “distance learning” from home but lower-income households were less likely to rely on online resources.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most salient change was closure of schools forcing students to continue their education from home.</p>

<h3>An Important Topic</h3>
<br>
<p> It would be best if you also encourage your child’s reasoning development through games and puzzles. Puzzles are one of the most common ways to help a child develop general mental ability and reasoning ability in children. As your child grows older, problems are one of the best ways for you to help your child develop and improve his or her cognitive skills. As your child becomes a teenager, puzzles are one of the best ways for you to keep your child interested and engaged.
A parent has a lot of influence on a child’s intellectual development. The more involved you can be in your child’s intellectual development, the more likely that he or she will develop a positive attitude toward learning.</p>
