<h2>Mental Health During The Pandemic</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <article>
<p> The pandemic has caused a sharp increase in mental health and behavioral issues in kids and teens forced to miss in-person learning.
Even if kids stay in class going forward, parents and schools must find new and creative ways to provide comfort and stability to students who may be struggling.
</p>
<p>
  If you're a parent or you work in a school, you've likely noticed that kids are struggling more than usual due to disrupted routines and in-person learning. It's important to do everything possible to keep kids in school as long as it's safe, and both schools and parents can also get creative when it comes to finding ways to help students feel comforted and secure.</p>

<p>
  1. Hugs and Encouragement.
“When hugging a child, always be the last one to let go. You never know how long they need it.”There is a wise saying that says, “When hugging a child, always be the last one to let go. You never know how long they need it.” Giving your children hugs is the simplest thing in the world and more valuable than all the money you have in the bank.<p>
<br>
<p>
2. Random Texts.
Communication with children, especially teenagers, can be a tough barrier to crack sometimes. Send your son or daughter random texts on occasion just to say how proud you are of them and that they are loved. Though it’s possible they will think it annoying, they will absorb it right into their hearts.</p>
<br>
<p>
3. Fun Surprises.
For no reason at all, surprise your kids with a favorite thing or a fun activity sometimes. Life can’t always be totally scripted. These are the moments that usually turn into the best and longest lasting memories.</p>
<br>
<p>
4. Give Compliments.
Parents have to spend a good amount of time correcting our children. “No” is a word heard quite often in the home of a typical family. Be sure to balance that discipline with deserved compliments often and lovingly.</p>
<br> <p>
5. One-on-One Time.
Amongst the chaos of family life, it can be difficult for a child to get individual time alone with you. This is highly important to your child and should be made a priority. Nothing shrinks our big world down to their size better than one-on-one time alone.</p>
<br>
<p>
6. Listen to Them.
We are surrounded by distractions. Our children need us to hear them. Are we truly listening? It might not be easy to decipher the words of a 3-year-old excited to tell you about his day. However, it’s our honor and duty to sit there and give it our sincere best. To him, it means the world. </p>
